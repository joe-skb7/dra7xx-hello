Description
-----------

This is bare-metal firmware intended for DRA752 ES1.0 SoC.
It contains minimal code to initialize system and write some text to
serial console (via UART6). Just insert SD card with MLO file from this project
and boot from it (press "Reset" button or something like this).


Toolchain
---------

To build this application, bare-metal toolchain must be used
(like "arm-none-eabi").

How to configure toolchain:
 - export CROSS_COMPILE environment variable with corresponding prefix in it
   (e.g. "arm-none-eabi-")
 - append absolute path for toolchain's "bin" directory to PATH environment
   variable


mkimage
-------

In order to boot from SD card or eMMC chip, MLO file must be created
and placed into first partition (which must be FAT formatted).
"mkimage" tool should be used to create MLO file. This tool can be
found inside of your built "u-boot" directory or it can be installed like this:
   $ sudo aptitude install u-boot-tools


Build
-----

1. Build for boot from SD card or eMMC chip:

   $ make MLO

     ...or the same, but more strictly specified:

   $ make BOOT=1 MLO

2. Build for boot from NOR flash (XIP):

   $ make BOOT=2

   Note that this build type wasn't tested with actual XIP booting from NOR.


Uploading images
----------------

1. For boot from SD card or eMMC chip:
   just copy "MLO" file to the root directory of first partition (which must be
   formatted as FAT).

2. For boot from NOR flash (XIP):
   write "dra7xx-hello.bin" file into beginning of NOR flash. It can be done
   for example from u-boot shell using next procedure:

   # protect off all
   # erase 0x08000000 +0x80000
   # mmc rescan
   # load mmc 0 ${loadaddr} dra7xx-hello.bin
   # cp.b ${loadaddr} 0x08000000 ${filesize}

   In this example:
     - "dra7xx-hello.bin" file must reside on SD card from which u-boot was boot
     - NOR flash mapped to 0x08000000 address


Porting
-------

This code can be easily adopted to use with any of OMAP-based SoCs:
 - check include/config.h addresses
 - check UART6_BASE address in src/serial.c
 - check clocks setup and pins muxing in src/board.c
   (look into s_init() function in your u-boot for insights)
